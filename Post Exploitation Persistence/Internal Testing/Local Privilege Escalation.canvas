This is important because we want to be able to get back as close as possible to the same spot at the start of testing each day, so we don't have to waste time on setup. Now we won't always have SSH open to the internet and may have to achieve persistence another way. We could create a reverse shell binary on the host, execute it via the command injection, get a reverse shell or Meterpreter shell, and then work through that. Since SSH is here, we'll use it. There are many ways to pivot and tunnel our traffic ","x":-360,"y":-440,"width":665,"height":230},

		{"id":"a38bb60db472ba59","type":"text","text":"We could upload an enumeration script to the system such as LinPEAS, but I always try two simple commands after gaining access: id to see if the compromised account is in any privileged local groups, and sudo -l to see if the account has any type of sudo privileges to run commands as another user or as root. By now, we have practiced many privilege escalation techniques in both Academy modules and perhaps some boxes on the HTB main platform. It's great to have these techniques in our back pocket, especially if we land on a very hardened system. However, we are dealing with human administrators, and humans make mistakes and also go for convenience. More often than not, my path to escalating privileges on a Linux box during a pentest was not some wildcard attack leveraging tar and a cron job, but rather something simple such as sudo su without a password to gain root privileges or not having to escalate privileges because the service I exploited was running in the context of the root account. It's still necessary to understand and practice as many techniques as possible because, as said a few times now, every environment is different, and we want to have the most comprehensive toolkit possible at our disposal.","x":394,"y":940,"width":746,"height":422},
