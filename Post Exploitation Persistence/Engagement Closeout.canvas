The first thing we should do is send our client an email notifying them that the testing period has ended and a specific time frame they can expect us to deliver the report. At this time, you can also ask them to give potential times for a report review meeting, but this is usually better to do later when delivering the report. Some firms will also provide a summary of findings after the assessment, but this differs from company to company. If you have communicated clearly with your client throughout the assessment, they should already have a good idea of what to expect. Bottom line, we don't want them to hear about the highest risk findings for the first time when they receive the report and be completely blindsided.","x":-960,"y":-250,"width":645,"height":310},
